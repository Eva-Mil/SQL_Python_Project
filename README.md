# Introduction
On August 9th, a young female resident at a hospital in New Delhi was sexually assaulted and murdered by male on-duty doctors. Unfortunately, such horrific crimes are not isolated incidents. Based on government crime data from 2022 [1], and according to an analysis conducted by ABC [2], these types of crimes occur on average every 17 minutes in India. The data reveals that between 2017 and 2022, there were 189,000 reported rape cases across the country, with more than 31,000 of those cases occurring in 2022 alone.

Despite the alarming number of reported cases, the conviction rate remains low, consistently ranging between 27 and 28 percent from 2018 to 2022. Senior Supreme Court lawyer and human rights activist Vrinda Grover has highlighted that the danger to a woman who has been assaulted often intensifies after the crime has been committed, underscoring the urgent need for better protection and justice.

# Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze rape victim cases from 2016, 2017, and 2018 to better understand the patterns and challenges in addressing this critical issue. Utilizing a dataset retrieved from Kaggle, which includes comprehensive data on crimes in India from 2016-2018 [3], the analysis will focus specifically on:

Crimes against women: Detailed records of reported rape cases and other crimes involving female victims.
Due to the current limitations in the dataset, including the lack of additional contextual data such as socioeconomic backgrounds and education status for these specific years, the analysis will be purely descriptive. Future versions of the dataset may include such crucial data, which could significantly enhance the depth of the analysis. By expanding the scope of the analysis in future iterations, we aim to identify patterns and root causes, providing valuable insights into why such crimes continue to occur and how they might be effectively addressed.

# Dataset
