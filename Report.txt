On August 9th, a young female resident at a hospital in New Delhi was sexually assaulted and murdered by male on-duty doctors. 
Unfortunately, such horrific crimes are not isolated incidents. According to government crime data from 2022 [1] and an analysis conducted by ABC [2], these types of crimes occur on average every 17 minutes in India. Between 2017 and 2022, there were 189,000 reported rape cases across the country, with over 31,000 occurring in 2022 alone.

Despite the high number of reported cases, the conviction rate remains concerningly low, consistently ranging between 27 and 28 percent from 2018 to 2022. 
Vrinda Grover, a senior Supreme Court lawyer and human rights activist, has emphasized that the danger to a woman often intensifies after she has been assaulted, highlighting the urgent need for more effective protection and justice.

In this project, I will analyze rape victim cases from 2016, 2017, and 2018 to gain a better understanding of the patterns and challenges in addressing this critical issue. 
Using a dataset retrieved from Kaggle, which includes comprehensive data on crimes in India during this period [3], the analysis will focus specifically on crimes against women. 
These records provide detailed information on reported rape cases and other crimes involving female victims. 
However, the dataset has limitations, including the absence of contextual data such as socioeconomic background and education status for these specific years. 
As a result, the current analysis will be purely descriptive.

In future iterations of this dataset, the inclusion of such crucial contextual data could significantly enhance the depth of the analysis. 
By expanding the scope, the goal is to identify patterns and root causes, providing valuable insights into why such crimes continue to occur and how they might be effectively addressed.


Based on the reported rape cases from 2016 to 2018, the data indicates that the top three states or union territories with the highest number of cases are as follows: Madhya Pradesh, which reported approximately 5,500 cases; Rajasthan, with figures ranging from 3,400 to 4,400 cases during 2016-2018; and Uttar Pradesh, which saw reports fluctuating between 4,400 and 5,200 cases. 
These regions consistently show the highest incidence rates, highlighting significant areas of concern when addressing gender-based violence across India. 
These results remain accurate as of 2022, with Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh continuing to be the states with the highest reported rape cases. Specifically, Rajasthan recorded 5,399 cases, Uttar Pradesh reported 3,690 cases, and Madhya Pradesh followed with 3,029 cases. This persistent trend underscores the ongoing challenges in addressing sexual violence in these regions [4].

The reasons behind the high rates of reported rape cases in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh cannot be fully understood through this dataset alone, as multiple factors contribute to these trends. 
For instance, it could be that women in these states may feel more empowered to approach the police and report incidents, possibly due to higher levels of education or community support. 
In contrast, in states where reporting rates are lower, women may be deterred from speaking out due to societal pressures, fear of retribution, or a lack of awareness about their rights.

To draw more precise conclusions, it is essential to analyze different types of data that consider the broader context, including cultural differences, socioeconomic backgrounds, and unemployment rates. Factors such as community support systems, access to education, and awareness of legal rights play significant roles in shaping women's willingness to report crimes. 
A more comprehensive analysis incorporating these variables will provide a clearer understanding of the dynamics at play in each state or union territory.

Differentiations in reported cases across various cities and union territories can be observed based on the age of the victims. 
These distinctions include children below 6 years old, those between 6 and 12, adolescents aged 12 to 16, and young adults from 16 to 18. 
Additionally, there are varying statistics for women of all ages, ranging from 18 years old to those over 60. 
This breakdown emphasizes the need for tailored interventions and protective measures that address the specific vulnerabilities of each age group, as the dynamics of sexual violence may differ significantly across these categories.

The interesting spikes in reported cases over the years warrant further analysis. 
For instance, there were 250 reported cases involving children aged 12 to 16 from 2016 to 2017, which then dropped to nearly zero reported cases. 
It would be valuable to investigate what societal changes occurred during this time, including shifts within the community, law enforcement practices, and family dynamics. 
Understanding the factors that contributed to these fluctuations will provide insights into how and why these trends emerged, enabling more effective strategies to prevent such incidents in the future.


In conclusion, the analysis of reported rape cases across various age groups and states underscores the complex dynamics surrounding sexual violence in society. 
The fluctuations observed in these cases, particularly among children and young adults, highlight the importance of understanding the underlying factors that contribute to such trends. 
By examining changes in societal attitudes, law enforcement practices, and family dynamics, we can gain valuable insights into the causes of these variations.

If anyone possesses additional data or information that could further illuminate these issues, I would be eager to explore it and help explain the reasons behind these fluctuations more comprehensively. 
Together, we can work towards developing effective strategies to address and prevent sexual violence in our communities.
