**Introduction**
On August 9th, a young female resident at a hospital in New Delhi was sexually assaulted and murdered by male on-duty doctors. Unfortunately, such horrific crimes are not isolated incidents. Based on government crime data from 2022 [1], and according to an analysis conducted by ABC [2], these types of crimes occur on average every 17 minutes in India. The data reveals that between 2017 and 2022, there were 189,000 reported rape cases across the country, with more than 31,000 of those cases occurring in 2022 alone.

Despite the alarming number of reported cases, the conviction rate remains disappointingly low, consistently ranging between 27 and 28 percent from 2018 to 2022. Senior Supreme Court lawyer and human rights activist Vrinda Grover has highlighted that the danger to a woman who has been assaulted often intensifies after the crime has been committed, underscoring the urgent need for better protection and justice.

In this project, I will analyze rape victim cases from 2016, 2017, and 2018 to better understand the patterns and challenges in addressing this critical issue. I will utilize a dataset retrieved from Kaggle, which includes comprehensive data on crimes in India from 2016-2018 [3]. The dataset focuses on crimes against women, cases involving police personnel, and instances of escapees from police custody. Future versions of the dataset may include additional data that could be crucial for analyzing and understanding the underlying factors contributing to the occurrence of these crimes. By expanding the scope of the analysis, we aim to identify patterns and root causes, which can provide valuable insights into why such crimes continue to occur and how they might be effectively addressed.
